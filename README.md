# FDS-Fraud Detection System 

Objective:
The Fraud Detection System aims to predict fraudulent transactions in real-time using machine learning techniques. It is designed to assist financial institutions, e-commerce platforms, and payment gateways in identifying and preventing financial fraud effectively.

Key Features:
  1.Real-time Analysis: Processes transaction data and provides immediate fraud detection results.
  2.Accurate Classification: Employs a Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy exceeding 70%.
  3.Scalable Design: Can be extended for larger datasets and real-time data pipelines.

Workflow:
  1.Data Preparation:
  Dataset: Transaction data (e.g., amount, location, purchase type).
  2.Preprocessing: Encoding categorical variables and handling missing values.
  3.Model Training:
  Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier.
  Output: Predicts whether a transaction is Fraud or Not Fraud.
  4.Web Application:
  Front-end: HTML and CSS for user input forms and results display.
  Back-end: Flask routes handle user requests and connect to the ML model.
